e damage. 01 FUEL RE4UIREMENTS Petrol engine Unleaded For the optimal vehicle performance, we recommend you use unleaded petrol which  has an octane rating of RON (Research Octane Number) 95 / AKI (Anti Knock Index) 91 or higher. You may use unleaded petrol with an octane rating of RON 91-94 / AKI 87-90 but it may result in slight performance reduction of the vehicle. (Do not use methanol blended fuels) Your new vehicle is designed to obtain maximum performance with UNLEADED FUEL,  as well as mi
mum performance with UNLEADED FUEL,  as well as minimise exhaust emissions and spark plug fouling.  CAUTION NEVER USE LEADED FUEL. The use of leaded fuel is detrimental to the catalytic con-verter and will damage the engine control system’s oxygen sensor and affect emis-sion control. Never add any fuel system cleaning agents to the fuel tank other than what has  been specified (We recommend that you consult a HYUNDAI authorised repairer for details.)  WARNING ś Do not “top off” after the nozzle 
ls.)  WARNING ś Do not “top off” after the nozzle automatically shuts off when refuelling. ś Always check that the fuel cap is installed securely to prevent fuel spillage in the  event of an accident. Introduction Leaded (if equipped) For some countries, your vehicle is designed to use leaded petrol. When you are going  to use leaded petrol, we recommend that you ask a HYUNDAI authorised repairer. Octane rating of leaded petrol is same with unleaded one. Petrol containing alcohol and methanol Ga
ded one. Petrol containing alcohol and methanol Gasohol, a mixture of petrol and ethanol (also known as grain alcohol), and petrol or  gasohol containing methanol (also known as wood alcohol) are being marketed along with or instead of leaded or unleaded petrol. Do not use gasohol containing more than 10% ethanol, and do not use petrol or gasohol  containing any methanol. Either of these fuels may cause drivability problems and dam-age to the fuel system, engine control system and emission contr
l system, engine control system and emission control system. Discontinue using gasohol of any kind if drivability problems occur.Vehicle damage or driveability problems may not be covered by the manufacturer’s  warranty if they result from the use of: 1. Gasohol containing more than 10% ethanol.2. Petrol or gasohol containing methanol.3. Leaded fuel or leaded gasohol.  CAUTION Never use gasohol which contains methanol. Discontinue use of any gasohol product  which impairs drivability. Other fuel
hol product  which impairs drivability. Other fuels Using fuel additives such as: - Silicone fuel additive- MMT (Magnanese, Mn) fuel additive- Ferrocene (iron-based) fuel additive- Other metallic-based fuel additives may result in cylinder misfire, poor acceleration, engine stalling, damage to the cata- lyst, or abnormal corrosion, and may cause damage to the engine resulting in a reduc-tion in the overall life of the powertrain. NOTICE Damage to the fuel system or performance problem caused by 
 the fuel system or performance problem caused by the use of these fuels may not be covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty. 01 Use of MTBE HYUNDAI recommends avoiding fuels containing MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether)  over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight) in your vehicle. Fuel containing MTBE over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight) may reduce  vehicle performance and produce vapour lock or hard starting.  CAUTION Your New Vehicle Limited Warranty may not cover damage to the f
cle Limited Warranty may not cover damage to the fuel system and any performance problems that are caused by the use of fuels containing metha-nol or fuels containing MTBE (Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether) over 15.0% vol. (Oxygen Content 2.7% weight.) Do not use methanol Fuels containing methanol (wood alcohol) should not be used in your vehicle. This type of fuel can reduce vehicle performance and damage components of the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. Fuel Additive
 system and emission control system. Fuel Additives HYUNDAI recommends that you use unleaded petrol which has an octane rating of RON (Research Octane Number) 95 / AKI (Anti Knock Index) 91 or higher (for Europe) or Octane Rating of RON (Research Octane Number) 91 / AKI (Anti-Knock Index) 87 or higher (except Europe). For customers who do not use good quality petrols including fuel additives regularly,  and have problems starting or the engine does not run smoothly, one bottle of additive added 
es not run smoothly, one bottle of additive added to the fuel tank according to the maintenance schedule is recommended.  Additives are available from your HYUNDAI authorised repairer along with information  on how to use them. Do not mix other additives. Operation in foreign countries If you are going to drive your vehicle in another country, be sure to: ś Observe all regulations regarding registration and insurance.ś Determine that acceptable fuel is available. Introduction VEHICLE MODIFICATIO
uel is available. Introduction VEHICLE MODIFICATIONS ś This vehicle should not be modified. Modification of your vehicle could affect its per- formance, safety or durability and may even violate governmental safety and emis- sions regulations.  In addition, damage or performance problems resulting from any modification may  not be covered under warranty.   ś If you use unauthorised electronic devices, it may cause the vehicle to operate abnor- mally, wire damage, battery discharge and fire. For 
lly, wire damage, battery discharge and fire. For your safety, we recommend that you do not use unauthorised electronic devices. VEHICLE %REA.ǘIN PROCESS By following a few simple precautions for the first 600 miles (1,000 km) you may add to the performance, economy and life of your vehicle. ś Do not race the engine.ś Whilst driving, keep your engine speed (RPM, or revolutions per minute) between  2,000 RPM and 4,000 RPM. ś Do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time, either fast or 
le speed for long periods of time, either fast or slow. Varying  engine speed is needed to properly break-in the engine. ś Avoid hard stops, except in emergencies, to allow the brakes to seat properly.ś Don’t tow a trailer during the first 1,200 miles (2,000 km) of operation.ś Fuel economy and engine performance may vary depending on vehicle break-in pro- cess and be stabilized after 6,000 km (4,000 miles). New engines may consume more  oil during the vehicle break-in period.  RETURNING USED VEH
g the vehicle break-in period.  RETURNING USED VEHICLES HYUNDAI promotes an environmentally sound treatment for end of life vehicles and offers to take back your Hyundai end of life vehicles in accordance with the European Union (EU) End of Life Vehicles Directive.

heck your tyre pressure as necessary to keep them properly inflated. ś An air pressure generally decreases, as you drive up to a high-altitude area above sea  level. Thus, if you plan to drive a high-altitude area, check the tyre pressures in advance.   If necessary, inflate them to a proper level (Air inflation per altitude  10 kPa/1 km ( 2.4  psi/1 mile).

The safety precautions in this section are among the most important. Always wear your seat belt  A seat 
ost important. Always wear your seat belt  A seat belt is your best protection in all types of accidents. Air bags are designed to supplement seat belts, not replace them. So even though your vehicle is equipped with air bags, ALWAYS make sure you and your passengers wear your seat belts, and wear them properly. Restrain all children  All children under age 13 should ride in your vehicle properly restrained in a rear seat, not the front seat. Infants and small children should be restrained in an
ants and small children should be restrained in an appropriate Child Restraint Systems. Larger children should use a booster seat with the lap/shoulder belt until they can use the seat belt properly without a booster seat. Air bag hazards  Whilst air bags can save lives, they can also cause serious or fatal injuries to occupants who sit too close to them, or who are not properly restrained. Infants, young children, and short adults are at the greatest risk of being injured by an inflating air ba
atest risk of being injured by an inflating air bag. Follow all instructions and warnings in this manual.Driver distraction  Driver distraction presents a serious and potentially deadly danger, especially for inexperienced drivers. Safety should be the first concern when behind the wheel and drivers need to be aware of the wide array of potential distractions, such as drowsiness, reaching for objects, eating, personal grooming, other passengers, and using mobile phones. Drivers can become distra
and using mobile phones. Drivers can become distracted when they  take their eyes and attention off the road or their hands off the wheel to focus on activities other than driving. To reduce your risk of distraction and an accident: ś ALWAYS set up your mobile devices  (i.e., MP3 players, phones, navigation  units, etc.) when your vehicle is parked or safely stopped.  ś ONLY use your mobile device when  allowed by laws and conditions permit safe use.   NEVER text or email whilst driving.  Most c
use.   NEVER text or email whilst driving.  Most countries have laws prohibiting drivers from texting. Some countries and cities also prohibit drivers from using handheld phones. ś NEVER let the use of a mobile device  distract you from driving. You have a responsibility to your passengers and others on the road to always drive safe-ly, with your hands on the wheel as well as your eyes and attention on the road. 3-303 Control your speed  Excessive speed is a major factor in crash  injuries and d
e speed is a major factor in crash  injuries and deaths. Generally, the high-er the speed, the greater the risk, but serious injuries can also occur at lower speeds. Never drive faster than is safe for current conditions, regardless of the maximum speed posted. Keep your vehicle in safe  condition  Having a tyre blowout or a mechanical  failure can be extremely hazardous. To reduce the possibility of such problems, check your tyre pressures and condi-tion frequently, and perform all regularly sc

precautions  Adjusting the seats so that you are sitting  in a safe, comfortable position plays an important role for the safety of the driver and passengers, along with seat belts and air bags when in an accident.  WARNING Do not use a cushion that reduces fric- tion between the seat and the passen-ger. The passenger’s hips may slide under the lap portion of the seat belt during an accident or a sudden stop. Serious or fatal internal injuries could result because the seat belt cannot operate pr
uld result because the seat belt cannot operate properly.Air bags  You can take steps to reduce the risk of being injured by an inflating air bag. Sitting too close to an air bag greatly increases the risk of injury in the event the air bag inflates. Move your seat as far back as possible from front air bags, whilst still maintaining control of the vehicle.  WARNING To reduce the risk of serious injury or death from an inflating air bag, take the following precautions: ś Adjust the driver’s seat
 following precautions: ś Adjust the driver’s seat as far to the  rear as possible whilst maintaining  the ability to maintain full control of the vehicle. ś Adjust the front passenger seat as far  to the rear as possible. ś Hold the steering wheel by the rim  with hands at the 9 o’clock and 3 o’clock positions to minimise the risk of injuries to your hands and arms. ś NEVER place anything or anyone  between the air bag. ś Do not allow the front passenger to  place feet or legs on the dashboard 
passenger to  place feet or legs on the dashboard to minimise the risk of leg injuries. 3-6Safety system Seat belts Always fasten your seat belt before start- ing any trip.  At all times, passengers should sit upright  and be properly restrained. Infants and small children must be restrained in appropriate Child Restraint Systems. Children who have outgrown a booster seat and adults must be restrained using the seat belts.  WARNING Take the following precautions when adjusting your seat belt: ś 
wing precautions when adjusting your seat belt: ś NEVER use one seat belt for more than  one occupant. ś Always position the seatback upright  with the lap portion of the seat belt  snug and low across the hips. ś NEVER allow children or small infants  to ride in a passenger’s lap. ś Do not route the seat belt across your  neck, across sharp edges, or reroute the shoulder strap away from your body. ś Do not allow the seat belt to become  caught or jammed.Front seats   The front seat can be adjus
r jammed.Front seats   The front seat can be adjusted by using the control lever or switches located on the outside of the seat cushion. Before driving, adjust the seat to the proper position so that you can easily control the steering wheel, foot pedals and controls on the instrument panel.   WARNING Take the following precautions when adjusting your seat: ś NEVER attempt to adjust the seat  whilst the vehicle is moving. The  seat could respond with unexpect-ed movement and may cause loss of ve
with unexpect-ed movement and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an acci-dent. ś Do not place anything under the front  seats. Loose objects in the driver’s foot area could interfere with the operation of the foot pedals, causing an accident. ś Do not allow anything to interfere  with the normal position and proper locking of the seatback. ś Do not place a cigarette lighter on the  floor or seat. When you operate the seat, gas may exit out of the lighter causing a fire. ś Use extreme
t out of the lighter causing a fire. ś Use extreme caution when picking  small objects trapped under the seats or between the seat and the centre console. Your hands might be cut or injured by the sharp edges of the seat mechanism.  3-703 ś If there are occupants in the rear  seats, be careful whilst adjusting the  front seat position. ś Make sure that the seat is locked in  place after the adjustment. If not, the seat might move unexpectedly result-ing in an accident.  CAUTION To prevent injury
ult-ing in an accident.  CAUTION To prevent injury: ś Do not adjust your seat whilst wear- ing your seat belt. Moving the seat  cushion forward may cause strong pressure on your abdomen. ś Do not allow your hands or fingers to  get caught in the seat mechanisms whilst the seat is moving.Forward and rearward adjustment  OBC3030002R To move the seat forward or rearward: 1. Pull up the seat slide adjustment lever  and hold it. 2. Slide the seat to the position you    desire. 3. Release the lever an
he position you    desire. 3. Release the lever and make sure the  seat is locked in place. Move forward  and rearward without using the lever. If the seat moves, it is not locked prop-erly. 3-8Safety system Seatback angle OBC3030003R To recline the seatback: 1. Lean forward slightly and lift up the  seatback lever. 2. Carefully lean back on the seat and  adjust the seatback to the position you  desire. 3. Release the lever and make sure the  seatback is locked in place. (The lever MUST return t
tback is locked in place. (The lever MUST return to its original position for the seatback to lock.)Reclining seatback  Sitting in a reclined position when the  vehicle is in motion can be dangerous. Even when buckled up, the protections of your restraint system (seat belts and/or air bags) is greatly reduced by reclining your seatback.  WARNING NEVER ride with a reclined seatback when the vehicle is moving. Riding with a reclined seatback increas- es your chance of serious or fatal inju-ries in
s- es your chance of serious or fatal inju-ries in the event of a collision or sudden stop. Drivers and passengers should ALWAYS  sit well back in their seats, properly belted, and with the seatbacks upright. Seat belts must be snug against your hips  and chest to work properly. When the seatback is reclined, the shoulder belt cannot do its job because it will not be snug against your chest. Instead, it will be in front of you.

According to acci-dent statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats than in the front seat. Children too large for a Child Restraint System must use the seat belts provided. Most countries have Child Restrain
belts provided. Most countries have Child Restraint  Systems which require children to travel in approved Child Restraint Systems. The laws governing the age or height/weight restrictions at which seat belts can be used instead of Child Restraint System differs among countries, so you should be aware of the specific requirements in your country, and where you are travel-ling. Child Restraint Systems must be properly  placed and installed in the rear seat. You must use a commercially available Ch
ear seat. You must use a commercially available Child Restraint System that meets the require-ments of the Safety Standards of your country. Child Restraint Systems are generally  designed to be secured in a vehicle seat by lap belt or the lap belt portion of a lap/shoulder belt, or by a top-tether and/or ISOFIX anchorage in the rear seats of the vehicle. 3-3103 Child Restraint System (CRS) always  in the rear Infants and younger children must be  restrained in an appropriate rearward-facing or 
  restrained in an appropriate rearward-facing or forward-facing CRS that has first been properly secured to the rear seat of the vehicle. Read and comply with the instructions for installation and use provided by the manufacturer of the Child Restraint System.

e an infant carrier or a child  safety seat that “hooks” over a seat-back, it may not provide adequate protection in an accident. ś After an accident, we recommend  a HYUNDAI dealer check the Child Restraint System, seat belts, ISOFIX anchorages and top-tether anchor-ages.Selecting a Child Restraint  System (CRS)  When selecting a CRS for your child,  always: ś Make sure a CRS has a label certi- fying that it meets applicable Safety  Standards of your country. ś Select a CRS based on your child’
 your country. ś Select a CRS based on your child’s  height and weight. The required label or the instructions for use typically provide this information. ś Select a CRS that fits the vehicle seat- ing position where it will be used. ś Read and comply with the warnings  and instructions for installation and use provided with a CRS. Child Restraint System types  There are three main types of Child Restraint Systems: rearward-facing seats, forward-facing seats, and booster seats. They are classifi
facing seats, and booster seats. They are classified according to the child’s age, height and weight. 3-32Safety system CRS09 Rearward-facing Child Restraint  System A rearward-facing Child Restraint System  provides restraint with the seating sur-face against the back of the child. The harness system holds the child in place, and in an accident, acts to keep the child positioned in the Child Restraint Systems and reduce the stress to the fragile neck and spinal cord. All children under the age 
 neck and spinal cord. All children under the age of one year  must always ride in a rearward-facing Child Restraint System. There are dif-ferent types of rearward-facing Child Restraint Systems: infant-only Child Restraint Systems can only be used rear-ward-facing. Convertible and 3-in-1 Child Restraint Systems typically have higher height and weight limits for the rearward-facing position system, allowing you to keep your child rearward-facing for a longer period of time. Keep using Child Rest
for a longer period of time. Keep using Child Restraint Systems in  the rearward-facing position as long as children fit within the height and weight limits allowed by the Child Restraint System’s manufacturer. OIB034017 Forward-facing Child Restraint  System A forward-facing Child Restraint System  provides restraint for the child’s body with a harness. Keep children in a for-ward-facing Child Restraint System with a harness until they reach the top height or weight limit allowed by your Child 
 top height or weight limit allowed by your Child Restraint System’s manufacturer. Once your child outgrows the forward- facing Child Restraint System, your child is ready for a booster seat. Booster seats  A booster seat is Child Restraint System designed to improve the fit of the vehi-cle’s seat belt system. A booster seat positions the seat belt so that it fits prop-erly over your child’s stronger body parts. Keep your children in booster seats until they are big enough to fit in a seat belt 
s until they are big enough to fit in a seat belt properly.  For a seat belt to fit properly, the lap belt  must lie comfortable across the upper thighs, not the stomach. The shoulder belt should lie comfortable across the shoulder and chest and not across the neck or face. Children under age 13 must always be properly restrained to mini-mise the risk of injury in an accident, sud-den stop or sudden manoeuvre. 3-3303 Installing a Child Restraint  System (CRS)  WARNING Before installing your Chil

n par-tially inflated for some time after they deploy.  WARNING After an air bag inflates, take the follow- ing precautions: ś Open your windows and doors as soon  as possible after impact to reduce  prolonged exposure to the smoke and powder released by the inflating air bag. ś Do not touch the air bag storage  area’s internal components immedi-ately after an air bag has inflated. The parts that come into contact with an inflating air bag may be very hot. ś Always wash exposed skin areas thor- 
 very hot. ś Always wash exposed skin areas thor- oughly with cold  water and mild soap. ś We recommend that a HYUNDAI  authorised repairer replace the air bag immediately after deployment. Air bags are designed to be used only once.Noise and smoke from inflating air  bag  When the air bags inflate, they make a  loud noise and may produce smoke and powder in the air inside of the vehicle. This is normal and is a result of the igni-tion of the air bag inflator. After the air bag inflates, you may
 bag inflator. After the air bag inflates, you may feel substantial dis-comfort in breathing because of the con-tact of your chest with both the seat belt and the air bag, as well as from breathing the smoke and powder. The powder may aggravate asthma for some people. If you experience breathing problems after an air bag deployment, seek medical atten-tion immediately. Though the smoke and powder are non- toxic, they may cause irritation to the skin, eyes, nose, throat, etc. If this is the case,
kin, eyes, nose, throat, etc. If this is the case, wash and rinse with cold water immediately and seek medical attention if the symptoms persist. 3-52Safety system Do not install a Child Restraint  System on the front passenger seat OHI038169L Never install a Child Restraint System in  the front passenger’s seat.

These include rear impacts, second or third col-lisions in multiple impact accidents, as well as low speed impacts. Damage to the vehicle indicates a collision energy absorption, and is not an indicator of whether or not an air bag should have inflated. Air bag collision sensors   WARNING To reduce the risk of an air bag deploy- ing unexpectedly and causing serious injury or dea

If the vehicle chassis is impacted  by bumps or objects on unimproved roads, the air bags may deploy. Drive carefully on unimproved roads or on surfaces not designed for vehicle traffic to prevent unin-tended air bag deployment. 3-5503 Air bag non-inflation conditions OBC3030029 In certain low-speed collisions the air  bags may not deploy. The air bags are designed not to deploy in such cases be
r bags are designed not to deploy in such cases because they may not provide benefits beyond the protection of the seat belts. OBC3030030 Front air bags are not designed to inflate in rear collisions, because occupants are moved backward by the force of the impact. In this case, inflated air bags would not provide any additional benefit. OBC3030028R Front air bags may not inflate in side impact collisions, because occupants move in the direction of the collision, and thus in side impacts, front 
of the collision, and thus in side impacts, front air bag deployment would not provide additional occupant protection. However, side and curtain air bags may  inflate depending on the severity of impact. OGB034038 In an angled collision, the force of impact may direct the occupants in a direction where the air bags would not be able to provide any additional benefit, and thus the sensors may not deploy any air bags. 3-56Safety system OBC3030032 Just before impact, drivers often brake  heavily. S
ust before impact, drivers often brake  heavily. Such heavy braking lowers the front portion of the vehicle caus-ing it to “ride” under a vehicle with a higher ground clearance. Air bags may not inflate in this “under-ride” situation because deceleration forces that are detected by sensors may be significantly reduced by such “underride” collisions.

nvenient features How vehicle radio works FM reception OJF045308L AM and FM radio signals are broadcast  from transmitter towers located around your city. They are intercepted by the radio antenna on your vehicle. This signal is then received by the radio and sent to your vehicle speakers.  When a strong radio signal has reached  your vehicle, the precise engineering of your audio system ensures the best pos-sible quality reproduction. However, in some cases the signal coming to your vehicle may
n some cases the signal coming to your vehicle may not be strong and clear. This can be due to factors, such as the  distance from the radio station, closeness of other strong radio stations or the pres-ence of buildings, bridges or other large obstructions in the area.AM (MW, LW) reception OJF045309L AM broadcasts can be received at greater distances than FM broadcasts. This is because AM radio waves are transmit-ted at low frequencies. These long, low frequency radio waves can follow the curva
ng, low frequency radio waves can follow the curvature of the earth rather than travel-ling straight out into the atmosphere. In addition, they curve around obstructions so that they can provide better signal coverage. 5-9905 FM radio station OJF045310L FM broadcasts are transmitted at high  frequencies and do not bend to follow the earth’s surface. Because of this, FM broadcasts generally begin to fade at short distances from the station. Also, FM signals are easily affected by buildings, mount
FM signals are easily affected by buildings, mountains, or other obstructions. These can result in certain listening conditions which might lead you to believe a prob-lem exists with your radio. The following conditions are normal and do not indicate radio trouble : JBM004 ś Fading - As your vehicle moves away  from the radio station, the signal will weaken and sound will begin to fade. When this occurs, we suggest that you select another stronger station. ś Flutter/Static - Weak FM signals or  
r station. ś Flutter/Static - Weak FM signals or  large obstructions between the trans-mitter and your radio can disturb the signal causing static or fluttering noises to occur. Reducing the treble level may lessen this effect until the disturbance clears. 5-100Convenient features OJF045311L ś Station Swapping - As a FM signal  weakens, another more powerful signal  near the same frequency may begin to play. This is because your radio is designed to lock onto the clearest sig-nal. If this occurs
 to lock onto the clearest sig-nal. If this occurs, select another sta-tion with a stronger signal. ś Multi-Path Cancellation - Radio signals  being received from several directions  can cause distortion or fluttering. This can be caused by a direct and reflected signal from the same station, or by sig-nals from two stations with close fre-quencies. If this occurs, select another station until the condition has passed.Using a mobile phone or a two-way  radio  When a mobile phone is used inside t

It gives the driving feel of a manual transmission, yet provides the ease  of a fully automatic transmission. ś When D (Drive) is selected, the transmission will automatically shift through the  gears similar to a conventional automatic transmission. Unlike a traditional automatic transmission, the gear shifting can sometimes be felt and heard as the actuators engage the clutches and the gears are selected
ors engage the clutches and the gears are selected.  6-2706 ś The dual clutch transmission incorpo- rates a dry-type dual clutch mecha- nism, which allows for better accelera-tion performance and increased fuel efficiency whilst driving. But it differs from a conventional automatic trans-mission because it does not incorpo-rate a torque converter. Instead, the transition from one gear to the next is managed by clutch slip, especially at lower speeds.   As a result, shifts are sometimes more  not
eds.   As a result, shifts are sometimes more  noticeable, and a light vibration can be felt as the transmission shaft speed is matched with the engine shaft speed. This is a normal condition of the dual clutch transmission. ś The dry-type clutch transfers torque  more directly and provides a direct-drive feeling which may feel different from a conventional automatic trans-mission. This may be more noticeable when launching the vehicle from a stop or when traveling at low, stop-and-go vehicle sp
p or when traveling at low, stop-and-go vehicle speeds.  ś When rapidly accelerating from a lower  vehicle speed, the engine rpm may increase dramatically as a result of clutch slip as the dual clutch transmis-sion selects the correct gear. This is a normal condition. ś When accelerating from a stop on an  incline, press the accelerator smoothly and gradually to avoid any shudder feeling or jerkiness. ś When traveling at a lower vehicle  speed, if you release the accelerator pedal quickly, you m
f you release the accelerator pedal quickly, you may feel engine braking before the transmission chang-es gears. This engine braking feeling is similar to operating a manual transmis-sion at low speed. ś When driving downhill, you may wish  to move the gear shift lever to Manual Shift mode and downshift to a lower gear in order to control your speed without using the brake pedal exces-sively.ś When you turn the engine on and off,  you may hear clicking sounds as the system goes through a self-te
icking sounds as the system goes through a self-test. This is a normal sound for the dual clutch transmission. ś During the first 1000 miles (1,500 km),  you may feel that the vehicle may not be smooth when accelerating at low speed. During this break-in period, the shift quality and performance of your new vehicle is continuously optimized.

actices  ś Never move the shift lever from P (Park)  or N (Neutral) to any other position  with the accelerator pedal depressed. ś Never move the shift lever into P (Park)  when the vehicle is in motion.   Be sure the vehicle is completely  stopped before you attempt to shift into R (Reverse) or D (Drive). ś Do not move the shift lever to N  (Neutral) when driving. Doing so may result in an accident because of a loss of engine braking and the transmission could be damaged. ś Driving uphill or do
nsmission could be damaged. ś Driving uphill or downhill, always shift  to D (Drive) when driving forward or to R (Reverse) when driving backwards, and check the gear position indicat-ed on the cluster before driving. If you drive in the opposite direction of the selected gear, the engine will turn off and a serious accident might be occurred due to the degraded brake performance. ś Do not drive with your foot resting on  the brake pedal. Even light, but con-sistent pedal pressure can result in 
ght, but con-sistent pedal pressure can result in the brakes overheating, brake wear and possibly even brake failure. ś When driving in manual shift mode,  slow down before shifting to a lower gear. Otherwise, the lower gear may not be engaged if the engine rpms are outside of the allowable range. ś Always apply the parking brake when  leaving the vehicle. Do not depend on placing the transmission in P (Park) to keep the vehicle from moving. ś Exercise extreme caution when driv- ing on a slipper
ercise extreme caution when driv- ing on a slippery surface. Be especially careful when braking, accelerating or shifting gears. On a slippery surface, an abrupt change in vehicle speed can cause the drive wheels to lose traction and may cause loss of vehicle control resulting in an accident.ś Optimum vehicle performance and  fuel economy is obtained by smoothly depressing and releasing the accelera-tor.  WARNING To reduce the risk of SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ś ALWAYS wear your seat belt. In a c
URY or DEATH: ś ALWAYS wear your seat belt. In a col- lision, an unbelted occupant is sig- nificantly more likely to be seriously injured or killed than a properly belted occupant. ś Avoid high speeds when cornering or  turning. ś Do not make quick steering wheel  movements, such as sharp lane changes or fast, sharp turns. ś The risk of rollover is greatly increased  if you lose control of your vehicle at highway speeds.  ś Loss of control often occurs if two or  more wheels drop off the roadway
occurs if two or  more wheels drop off the roadway and the driver over steers to reenter the roadway. ś In the event your vehicle leaves  the roadway, do not steer sharply.

for Manual transmission vehicle) or N (Neutral) position (for Automatic trans-mission/Dual clutch transmission vehi-cle), then apply the parking brake, and place the ignition switch in the LOCK/OFF position. Vehicles parked with the parking brake  not applied or not fully engaged may roll inadvertently and may cause injury to the driver and others. ALWAYS apply the parking brake before exiting the vehicle.Wet brakes can be dangerous! The brakes may get wet if the vehicle is driven through standi
ay get wet if the vehicle is driven through standing water or if it is washed.  Your vehicle will not stop as quickly if the  brakes are wet. Wet brakes may cause the vehicle to pull to one side. To dry the brakes, apply the brakes lightly  until the braking action returns to normal. If the braking action does not return to normal, stop as soon as it is safe to do so and we recommend that you call a HYUNDAI authorised repairer for assis-tance. DO NOT drive with your foot resting on  the brake pe
 NOT drive with your foot resting on  the brake pedal. Even light, but constant pedal pressure can result in the brakes overheating, brake wear, and possibly even brake failure. If a tyre goes flat whilst you are driving,  apply the brakes gently and keep the vehicle pointed straight ahead whilst you slow down. When you are moving slowly enough for it to be safe to do so, pull off the road and stop in a safe location. Keep your foot firmly on the brake pedal  when the vehicle is stopped to preve

Smooth cornering Avoid braking or gear changing in cor-ners, especially when roads are wet. Ideally, corners should always be taken under gentle acceleration. Driving at night Night driving presents more hazards than driving in the daylight. Here are some important tips to remember: ś Slow down and keep more distance  between you
r: ś Slow down and keep more distance  between you and other vehicles, as it  may be more difficult to see at night, especially in areas where there may not be any street lights. ś Adjust your mirrors to reduce the glare  from other drivers’ headlamps. ś Keep your headlamps clean and prop- erly aimed. Dirty or improperly aimed headlamps will make it much more dif-ficult to see at night. ś Avoid staring directly at the headlamps  of oncoming vehicles. You could be temporarily blinded, and it will
les. You could be temporarily blinded, and it will take several seconds for your eyes to read-just to the darkness.Driving in the rain Rain and wet roads can make driving dangerous. Here are a few things to con-sider when driving in the rain or on slick pavement: ś Slow down and allow extra follow- ing distance. A heavy rainfall makes it  harder to see and increases the dis-tance needed to stop your vehicle. ś Turn OFF your Cruise Control (if  equipped).  ś Replace your windscreen wiper blades  
uipped).  ś Replace your windscreen wiper blades  when they show signs of streaking or missing areas on the windscreen. ś Be sure your tyres have enough tread.  If your tyres do not have enough tread, making a quick stop on wet pavement can cause a skid and possibly lead to an accident. See “Tyre replacement”  in chapter 9. ś Turn on your headlamps to make it  easier for others to see you.  ś Driving too fast through large puddles  can affect your brakes. If you must go through puddles, try to d
r brakes. If you must go through puddles, try to drive through them slowly. ś If you believe your brakes may be wet,  apply them lightly whilst driving until normal braking operation returns. 6-60Driving your vehicle Hydroplaning  If the road is wet enough and you are  going fast enough, your vehicle may have little or no contact with the road surface and actually ride on the water. The best advice is SLOW DOWN when the road is wet.  The risk of hydroplaning increases as  the depth of tyre tread
hydroplaning increases as  the depth of tyre tread decreases, refer to “Tyre replacement” in chapter 9. Driving in flooded areas Avoid driving through flooded areas unless you are sure the water is no higher than the bottom of the wheel hub. Drive through any water slowly. Allow ade-quate stopping distance because brake performance may be reduced. After driving through water, dry the  brakes by gently applying them several times whilst the vehicle is moving slowly.Highway driving Tyres Adjust th

owing suggestions: Snow or icy conditions You need to keep sufficient distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you. Apply the brakes gently. Speeding, rapid  acceleration, sudden brake applications, and sharp turns are potentially very haz-ardous practices. During deceleration, use engine braking to the fullest extent. Sudden brake applications on snowy or icy roads may cause the vehicle to skid. To drive your vehicle in deep snow, it  may be necessary to use snow tyres or to in
w, it  may be necessary to use snow tyres or to install tyre chains on your tyres. Always carry emergency equipment.  Some of the items you may want to carry include tyre chains, tow straps or chains, a flashlight, emergency flares, sand, a shovel, jumper cables, a window scraper, gloves, ground cloth, coveralls, a blanket, etc.Snow tyres  WARNING Snow tyres should be equivalent in size and type to the vehicle’s standard tyres. Otherwise, the safety and handling of your vehicle may be adversely 
ety and handling of your vehicle may be adversely affected. If you mount snow tyres on your vehicle,  make sure to use radial tyres of the same size and load range as the original tyres. Mount snow tyres on all four wheels to balance your vehicle’s handling in all weather conditions. The traction provid-ed by snow tyres on dry roads may not be as high as your vehicle’s original equip-ment tyres.

Here are some rules to follow: ś Do you have to make any holes in the  body of your vehicle when you install  a trailer towbar? If you do, then be sure to seal the holes later when you remove the towbar. If you don’t seal them, carbon monoxide (CO) from your exhaust can get into your vehicle, as well as dirt and water. ś The bumpers on your vehicle are not  intended for towbars. Do

Use only a frame-mounted towbar that does not attach to the bumper. ś A HYUNDAI trailer towbar accessory  is available at a HYUNDAI authorised repairer.Safety chains You should always attach chains between your vehicle and your trailer. Cross the safety chains under the tongue of the trailer so that the tongue will not drop to the road if it becomes separated from the towbar. Instru
ad if it becomes separated from the towbar. Instructions about safety chains may be provided by the towbar manu-facturer or trailer manufacturer. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendation for attaching safety chains. Always leave just enough slack so you can turn with your trailer. And, never allow safety chains to drag on the ground. Trailer brakes If your trailer is equipped with a brak-ing system, make sure it conforms your country’s regulations and that it is prop-erly installed and operating
s and that it is prop-erly installed and operating correctly. If your trailer weighs more than the maxi- mum trailer weight without trailer brakes loaded, then it needs its own brakes and they must be adequate. Be sure to read and follow the instructions for the trailer brakes so you’ll be able to install, adjust and maintain them properly. Be sure not to tap into your vehicle's brake system.  WARNING Do not use a trailer with its own brakes unless you are absolutely certain that you have proper
ss you are absolutely certain that you have properly set up the brake sys-tem. This is not a task for amateurs. Use an experienced, competent trailer shop for this work. 6-70Driving your vehicle Driving with a trailer Towing a trailer requires a certain amount  of experience. Before setting out for the open road, you must get to know your trailer. Acquaint yourself with the feel of handling and braking with the added weight of the trailer. And always keep in mind that the vehicle you are driving
ways keep in mind that the vehicle you are driving is now longer and not nearly as responsive as your vehicle is by itself. Before you start, check the trailer towbar  and platform, safety chains, electrical connector(s), lights, tyres and brakes. During your trip, occasionally check to be  sure that the load is secure, and that the lights and trailer brakes are still working. Distance Stay at least twice as far behind the vehicle ahead as you would when driving your vehicle without a trailer. T
uld when driving your vehicle without a trailer. This can help you avoid situations that require heavy braking and sudden turns. Passing You will need more passing distance up ahead when you’re towing a trailer. And, because of the increased vehicle length, you’ll need to go much farther beyond the passed vehicle before you can return to your lane. Backing up Hold the bottom of the steering wheel with one hand. Then, to move the trailer to the left, move your hand to the left. To move the traile
ft, move your hand to the left. To move the trailer to the right, move your hand to the right. Always back up slowly and, if possible, have someone guide you.Making turns When you’re turning with a trailer, make wider turns than normal. Do this so your trailer won’t strike soft shoulders, kerbs, road signs, trees, or other objects. Avoid jerky or sudden manoeuvres. Signal well in advance. Turn signals When you tow a trailer, your vehicle has to have a different turn signal flasher and extra wiri
ave a different turn signal flasher and extra wiring. The green arrows on your instrument panel will flash whenever you signal a turn or lane change. Properly connected, the trailer lights will also flash to alert other drivers you’re about to turn, change lanes, or stop. When towing a trailer, the green arrows  on your instrument panel will flash for turns even if the bulbs on the trailer are burned out. Thus, you may think drivers behind you are seeing your signals when, in fact, they are not.
e seeing your signals when, in fact, they are not. It’s important to check occasionally to be sure the trailer bulbs are still working. You must also check the lights every time you discon-nect and then reconnect the wires.   WARNING Do not connect a trailer lighting sys-tem directly to your vehicle’s lighting system. Use an approved trailer wiring harness.  Failure to do so could result in damage  to the vehicle electrical system and/or personal injury.  We recommend that you have the sys- tem 
 injury.  We recommend that you have the sys- tem checked by a HYUNDAI authorised repairer as soon as possible. 6-7106 Driving on hills Reduce speed and shift to a lower gear  before you start down a long or steep downgrade. If you don’t shift down, you might have to use your brakes so much that they would get overheated and may not operate efficiently. On a long uphill grade, shift down and  reduce your speed to around 45 mph (70 km/h) to reduce the possibility of engine and transmission overhe
 the possibility of engine and transmission overheating. If your trailer weighs more than the maxi- mum trailer weight without trailer brakes and you have an automatic transmis-sion/dual clutch transmission, you should drive in D (Drive) when towing a trailer. Operating your vehicle in D (Drive) when towing a trailer will minimise heat build-up and extend the life of your transmis-sion. NOTICE To prevent engine and/or transmission overheating:  Ŗ When towing a trailer on steep grades  (in excess
 When towing a trailer on steep grades  (in excess of 6%) pay close attention  to the engine coolant temperature gauge to ensure the engine does not overheat. If the needle of the coolant temperature gauge moves towards “H” (HOT), pull over and stop as soon as it is safe to do so, and allow the engine to idle until it cools down. You may proceed once the engine has cooled sufficiently. Ŗ You must decide your vehicle speed  according to the trailer weight and uphill grade.Parking  on hills Genera
r weight and uphill grade.Parking  on hills Generally, if you have a trailer attached to your vehicle, you should not park your vehicle on a hill. However, if you ever have to park your  trailer on a hill, here's how to do it: 1. Pull the vehicle into the parking space. Turn the steering wheel in the direc- tion of the kerb (left if headed down  hill, right if headed up hill). 2. Shift the vehicle to P (Park, for  Automatic transmission/Dual clutch transmission vehicle) or neutral (for Manual tr
ch transmission vehicle) or neutral (for Manual transmission vehicle). 3. Set the parking brake and shut off the  vehicle. 4. Place wheel chocks under the trailer  wheels on the down hill side of the wheels. 5. Start the vehicle, hold the brakes, shift  to neutral, release the parking brake and slowly release the brakes until the trailer chocks absorb the load. 6. Reapply the brakes and parking  brakes. 7. Move the shift lever to P (Park, for  Automatic transmission/Dual clutch transmission vehi
tomatic transmission/Dual clutch transmission vehicle) or the 1st gear when the vehicle is parked on a uphill grade and in R (Reverse) on a downhill (for Manual transmission vehicle). 8. Shut off the vehicle and release the  vehicle brakes but leave the parking brake set.  WARNING To prevent serious or fatal injury: Do not get out of the vehicle without  the parking brake firmly set. If you have left the engine running, the vehicle can move suddenly. You and others could be seriously or fatally 
nly. You and others could be seriously or fatally injured.  6-72Driving your vehicle Ready to leave after parking on a  hill 1. With the shift lever to P (Park, for  Automatic transmission/Dual clutch  transmission vehicle) or neutral (for Manual transmission vehicle), apply your brakes and hold the brake pedal down whilst you:  Ŗ Start your engine;  Ŗ Shift into gear; and  Ŗ Release the parking brake. 2. Slowly remove your foot from the  brake pedal. 3. Drive slowly until the trailer is clear o
edal. 3. Drive slowly until the trailer is clear of  the chocks. 4. Stop and have someone pick up and  store the chocks.Maintenance when towing a  trailer Your vehicle will need service more  often when you regularly pull a trailer. Important items to pay particular atten-tion to include engine oil, automatic transmission/dual clutch transmission fluid, axle lubricant and cooling system fluid. Brake condition is another impor-tant item to frequently check. If you’re trailering, it’s a good idea 
tly check. If you’re trailering, it’s a good idea to review these items before you start your trip. Don’t forget to also maintain your trailer and towbar. Follow the maintenance sched-ule that accompanied your trailer and check it periodically. Preferably, conduct the check at the start of each day’s driv-ing. Most importantly, all towbar nuts and bolts should be tight. NOTICE To prevent vehicle damage: Ŗ Due to higher load during trailer  usage, overheating might occur on  hot days or during up
 overheating might occur on  hot days or during uphill driving. If the coolant gauge indicates over-heating, switch off the air conditioner and stop the vehicle in a safe area to cool down the engine. Ŗ When towing check Automatic trans- mission/Dual clutch transmission flu-id more frequently. Ŗ If your vehicle is not equipped with  an air conditioner, you should install a condenser fan to improve engine performance when towing a trailer. 6-7306 Two labels on your driver’s door sill show  how mu

Control off when  the function is not in use to avoid inadvertently setting a speed.  ś Do not open the door or leave the  vehicle when Smart Cruise Control is operating, even if the vehicle is stopped. ś Always be aware of the selected  speed and vehicle distance. ś Keep a safe distance according to  road conditions and vehicle speed. If the vehicle distance is too close dur-ing high-speed driving, a serious col-lision may result. ś When maintaining distance with the  vehicle ahead, if the fron
ning distance with the  vehicle ahead, if the front vehicle dis-appears, the function may suddenly accelerate to the set speed. Always be aware of unexpected and sudden situations from occurring.  ś Vehicle speed may decrease on an  upward slope and increase on a downward slope. ś Always be aware of situations such as  when a vehicle cuts in suddenly. ś When you are towing a trailer or  another vehicle, we recommend that Smart Cruise Control is turned off due to safety reasons.  ś Turn off Smart
urned off due to safety reasons.  ś Turn off Smart Cruise Control when  your vehicle is being towed. 07 7-95ś Smart Cruise Control may not operate  normally if interfered by strong elec- tromagnetic waves.  ś Smart Cruise Control may not detect  an obstacle in front and lead to a col-lision. Always look ahead cautiously to prevent unexpected and sudden situations from occurring. ś Vehicles moving in front of you with  a frequent lane change may cause a delay in the function's reaction or may cau
ause a delay in the function's reaction or may cause the function to react to a vehicle actually in an adjacent lane. Always drive cautiously to prevent unexpected and sudden situations from occurring. ś Always be aware of the surroundings  and drive safely, even though a warn-ing message does not appear or an audible warning does not sound.  ś If any other function’s warning mes- sage is displayed or warning sound is generated, Smart Cruise Control warning message may not be dis-played and warn

OBC3010021 All specifications (sizes and pressu res)  can be found on a label attached to the left side centre pillar.TYRES AND WHEELS  9-34Maintenance Recommended cold tyre  inflation pressures  All tyre pressures (including the spare)  should be checked when the tyres are cold. “Cold tyres” means the vehicle has not been driven f
old tyres” means the vehicle has not been driven for at least three hours or driven less than one mile (1.6 km). Warm tyres normally exceed recom- mended cold tyre pressures by 28 to 41 kPa (4 to 6 psi). Do not release air from warm tyres to adjust the pressure or the tyres will be under-inflated. For recom-mended inflation pressure, refer to “Tyre and Wheels” in chapter 2.  WARNING Recommended pressures must be maintained for the best ride, vehicle handling, and minimum tyre wear. Over-inflatio
cle handling, and minimum tyre wear. Over-inflation or under-inflation can  reduce tyre life, adversely affect vehicle handling, and lead to sudden tyre failure that could result in loss of vehicle con-trol resulting in an accident. Severe under-inflation can lead to  severe heat build-up, causing blowouts, tread separation and other tyre failures that can result in the loss of vehicle con-trol resulting in an accident. This risk is much higher on hot days and when driv-ing for long periods at h
n hot days and when driv-ing for long periods at high speeds.NOTICE ś Underinflation also results in exces- sive wear, poor handling and reduced fuel economy. Wheel deformation also is possible. Keep your tyre pres-sures at the proper levels. If a tyre frequently needs refilling, we recom-mend that the system be checked by a HYUNDAI authorised repairer. ś Overinflation produces a harsh ride,  excessive wear at the centre of the tyre tread, and a greater possibility of damage from road hazards. C
greater possibility of damage from road hazards. Check tyre inflation pressure Check your tyres including the spare tyre once a month or more. How to check Use a good quality tyre pressure gauge to check tyre pressure. You cannot tell if your tyres are properly inflated simply by looking at them. Radial tyres may look properly inflated even when they are under-inflated. Remove the valve cap from the tyre valve  stem. Press the tyre gauge firmly onto the valve to get a pressure measurement. If th

If the pressure is low, add air until you reach the rec-ommended pressure. Make sure to put the valve caps back on the valve stems. Without the valve cap, dirt or moisture could get into the valve core and cause air leakage. If a valve cap is missing, install a new one as soon as possible.  9-3509 If you o
ll a new one as soon as possible.  9-3509 If you overfill the tyre, release air by  pushing on the metal stem in the centre of the tyre valve. Recheck the tyre pres-sure with the tyre gauge. Be sure to put the valve caps back on the valve stems. Without the valve cap, dirt or moisture could get into the valve core and cause air leakage. If a valve cap is missing, install a new one as soon as possible. Tyre rotation   To equalize tread wear, HYUNDAI recom-mends that the tyres be rotated every 10,
AI recom-mends that the tyres be rotated every 10,000 miles (15,000 km) or sooner if irregular wear develops. During rotation, check the tyres for cor- rect balance. When rotating tyres, check for uneven  wear and damage. Abnormal wear is usu-ally caused by incorrect tyre pressure, improper wheel alignment, out-of-bal-ance wheels, severe braking or severe cornering. Look for bumps or bulges in the tread or side of the tyre. Replace the tyre if you find any of these conditions. Replace the tyre i

Wheel alignment and tyre  balance The wheels on your vehicle were aligned  and balanced carefully at the factory to give you the longest tyre life and best overall performance. In most cases, you will not need to have  your wheels aligned again. However, if you notice unusual tyre wear or your vehicle pulling one way or the other, the alignment may need to be reset. If you notice 
the alignment may need to be reset. If you notice your vehicle vibrating when  driving on a smooth road, your wheels may need to be rebalanced.

 to the original factory units in diameter, rim width and offset. Tyre traction Tyre traction can be reduced if you drive on worn tyres, tyres that are improp-erly inflated or on slippery road surfaces. Tyres should be replaced when tread wear indicators appear. To reduce the possibility of losing control, slow down whenever there is rain, snow or ice on the road. Tyre maintenance  In addition to proper inflation, correct wheel alignment helps to decrease tyre wear. If you find a tyre is worn un
 decrease tyre wear. If you find a tyre is worn unevenly, have your dealer check the wheel align-ment. When you have new tyres installed,  make sure they are balanced. This will increase vehicle ride comfort and tyre life. Additionally, a tyre should always be rebalanced if it is removed from the wheel.

Because low aspect ratio ty
ided for sporty looks. Because low aspect ratio tyres are opti- mized for handling and braking, their sidewall is a little stiffer than a standard tyre. Also, low aspect ratio tyres tend to be wider so that they consequently have a greater contact patch with the road surface. In some instances, they may generate more road noise compared with standard tyres. CAUTION Because the sidewall of a low aspect ratio tyre is shorter than a standard tyre, the rim of the wheel and the tyre itself are more e

To achieve the long-term corrosion resistance your vehicle can deliver, the owner’s cooperation and assistance is also required. &RPPRQFDXVHVRIFRUURVLRQ The most common causes of corrosion on your vehicle are: ś Road salt, dirt and moisture that is  allowed to accumulate underneath the  vehicle. ś Removal of paint or protective coat- ings; by stones, gravel, abrasion or minor scrapes and dents which leave unprotected metal exposed to corro-sio
which leave unprotected metal exposed to corro-sion. +LJKFRUURVLRQDUHDV If you live in an area where your vehicle is regularly exposed to corrosive materi-als, corrosion protection is particularly important. Some of the common causes of accelerated corrosion are road salts, dust control chemicals, ocean air and industrial pollution. 9-84Maintenance 0RLVWXUHEUHHGVFRUURVLRQ Moisture creates the conditions in which  corrosion is most likely to occur. For example, corrosion is accelerated by hig
ccur. For example, corrosion is accelerated by high humidity, particularly when temperatures are just above freezing. In such con-ditions, the corrosive material is kept in contact with the vehicle surfaces by moisture that is slow to evaporate. Mud is particularly corrosive because it  is slow to dry and holds moisture in con-tact with the vehicle. Although the mud appears to be dry, it can still retain mois-ture and promote corrosion.  High temperatures can also accelerate  corrosion of parts 
peratures can also accelerate  corrosion of parts that are not properly ventilated so the moisture can be dis-persed.  For all these reasons, it is par-ticularly important to keep your vehicle clean and free of mud or accumulations of other materials. This applies not only to the visible surfaces but particularly to the underside of the vehicle. 7RKHOSSUHYHQWFRUURVLRQ You can help prevent corrosion from get-ting started by observing the following:Keep your vehicle clean The best way to preven
ing:Keep your vehicle clean The best way to prevent corrosion is to keep your vehicle clean and free of corro-sive materials. Attention to the underside of the vehicle is particularly important. ś If you live in a high-corrosion area —  where road salts are used, near the  ocean, areas  with industrial pollution, acid rain, etc.—, you should take extra care to prevent corrosion. In winter, hose off the underside of your vehicle at least once a month and be sure to clean the underside thoroughly 
nth and be sure to clean the underside thoroughly when winter is over. ś When cleaning underneath the vehicle,  give particular attention to the com-ponents under the fenders and other areas that are hidden from view. Do a thorough job; just dampening the accumulated mud rather than washing it away will accelerate corrosion rather  than prevent it. Water under high pres-sure and steam are particularly effec-tive in  removing accumulated mud and corrosive materials. ś When cleaning lower door pan
orrosive materials. ś When cleaning lower door panels,  rocker panels and frame members, be sure that drain holes are kept open so that moisture can escape and not be trapped inside to accelerate corrosion. 9-8509 Keep your garage dry Don’t park your vehicle in a damp, poorly  ventilated garage. This creates a favor-able environment for corrosion. This is particularly true if you wash your vehicle in the garage or drive it into the garage when it is still wet or covered with snow, ice or mud. Ev

Keep paint and trim in good condition Scratches or chips in the finish should be covered with “touch-up” paint as soon as possible to reduce the possibility of cor-rosion. If bare metal is showing through, the attention of a qualified body and paint shop is recommended. Bird droppings : Bird droppings are highly  corrosive and may damage painted

NOTICE For the Inspection and Maintenance  Test (with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system) ś To prevent the vehicle from misfiring  during dynamometer testing, turn t
from misfiring  during dynamometer testing, turn the  Electronic Stability Control (ESC) sys-tem off by pressing the ESC switch. ś After dynamometer testing is com- pleted, turn the ESC system back on by pressing the ESC switch again.1.  Crankcase emission control  system The positive crankcase ventilation sys-tem is employed to prevent air pollution caused by blow-by gases being emitted from the crankcase. This system supplies fresh filtered air to the crankcase through the air intake hose. Ins
 to the crankcase through the air intake hose. Inside the crankcase, the fresh air mixes with blow-by gases, which then pass through the PCV valve into the induction system. 2.  Evaporative emission control  system The Evaporative Emission Control System is designed to prevent fuel vapours from escaping into the atmosphere. Canister Fuel vapours generated inside the fuel tank are absorbed and stored in the onboard canister. When the engine is running, the fuel vapours absorbed in the canister ar
ning, the fuel vapours absorbed in the canister are drawn into the surge tank through the purge control solenoid valve. Purge Control Solenoid Valve  (PCSV) The purge control solenoid valve is con- trolled by the Engine Control Module (ECM); when the engine coolant tem-perature is low during idling, the PCSV closes so that evaporated fuel is not taken into the engine. After the engine warms up during ordinary driving, the PCSV opens to introduce evaporated fuel to the engine.EMISSION CONTROL SYS
evaporated fuel to the engine.EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM 9-8909 3.  Exhaust emission control  system The Exhaust Emission Control System is  a highly effective system which controls exhaust emissions whilst maintaining good vehicle performance. Engine exhaust gas precautions   (carbon monoxide)  ś Carbon monoxide can be present with  other exhaust fumes. Therefore, if you  smell exhaust fumes of any kind inside your vehicle, have it inspected and repaired immediately. If you ever sus-pect exhaust f
paired immediately. If you ever sus-pect exhaust fumes are coming into your vehicle, drive it only with all the windows fully open. Have your vehicle checked and repaired immediately.  WARNING Engine exhaust gases contain carbon monoxide (CO). Though colourless and odourless, it is dangerous and could be lethal if inhaled. Follow the instructions following to avoid CO poisoning. ś Do not operate the engine in confined  or closed areas (such as garages) any  more than what is necessary to move th
rages) any  more than what is necessary to move the vehicle in or out of the area. ś When the vehicle is stopped in an open  area for more than a short time with the engine running, adjust the ventilation system (as needed) to draw outside air into the vehicle. ś Never sit in a parked or stopped vehicle  for any extended time with the engine running.    ś When the engine stalls or fails to start,  excessive attempts to restart the engine may cause damage to the emis-sion control system.Operating
e damage to the emis-sion control system.Operating precautions for catalytic  converters (if equipped)  WARNING ś A hot exhaust system can ignite flam- mable items under your vehicle.  Do  not park, idle, or drive the vehicle over or near flammable objects, such as dry grass, paper, leaves, etc. ś The exhaust system and catalytic sys- tem are very hot whilst the engine is running or immediately after the engine is turned off. Keep away from the exhaust system and catalytic con-verter as you may 
xhaust system and catalytic con-verter as you may get burned.  Also, do not remove the heat sink  around the exhaust system, do not seal the bottom of the vehicle and do not coat the vehicle for corrosion con-trol. It may present a fire risk under certain conditions. Your vehicle is equipped with a catalytic converter emission control device. Therefore, the following precautions  must be observed: ś Use only UNLEADED FUEL for petrol  engines. ś Do not operate the vehicle when there  are signs of
o not operate the vehicle when there  are signs of engine malfunction, such  as misfire or a noticeable loss of perfor-mance. ś Do not misuse or abuse the engine.  Examples of misuse are coasting with the engine off and descending steep grades in gear with the engine off. ś Do not operate the engine at high idle  speed for extended periods (5 minutes or more). ś Do not modify or tamper with any part  of the engine or emission control sys-tem. We recommend that all inspec-tions and adjustments  a
recommend that all inspec-tions and adjustments  are made by a HYUNDAI authorised repairer. 9-90Maintenance ś Avoid driving with a very low fuel lev- el. If you run out of petrol, it could  cause the engine to misfire and result in excessive loading of the catalytic converter. Failure to observe these precautions could result in damage to the cata-lytic converter and to your vehicle. Additionally, such actions could void your warranties. Petrol Particulate Filter (GPF)  (if equipped)  The Petrol
articulate Filter (GPF)  (if equipped)  The Petrol Particulate Filter (GPF) system  removes the soot in the exhaust gas. The GPF system automatically burns (or  oxidizes) the accumulated soot in accor-dance with driving situations, unlike a disposable air filter. In other words, the accumulated soot is  automatically purged out by the engine control system and by the high exhaust-gas temperature at normal/ high driving speeds. However, when the vehicle is continu- ally driven at repeated short d
ehicle is continu- ally driven at repeated short distances or driven at low speed for a long time, the accumulated soot may not be automati-cally removed because of low exhaust gas temperature. In this case, the accu-mulated soot may reach a certain amount regardless of the soot oxidization pro-cess, then the GPF lamp will illuminate. The Petrol Particulate Filter (GPF) Lamp  stops illuminating, when the driving speed exceeds 80 km/h (50 mph) with the engine at 1,500- 4,000 rpm and the gear in t
h the engine at 1,500- 4,000 rpm and the gear in the 3rd position or above for approximately 30 minutes.When the GPF lamp starts to blink or the waning message “Check exhaust sys-tem” pops up even though the vehicle was driven as mentioned above, we rec-ommend that you have the GPF sys-tem checked by a HYUNDAI authorised repairer. With the GPF lamp blinking for an extend- ed period of time, it may damage the GPF system and lower the fuel economy.  WARNING Petrol Fuel   (if equipped with GPF) We 
  WARNING Petrol Fuel   (if equipped with GPF) We recommend you to use only the reg- ulated petrol fuels, when your vehicle is equipped with the GPF system. When you use other petrol fuels which  contain unspecified additives, they may damage the GPF system and cause exhaust emission problems.
